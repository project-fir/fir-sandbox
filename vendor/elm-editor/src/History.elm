module History exposing (History, empty, push, redo, undo)

{-| Making changes adds entries to the past. Undoing a few times adds those
entries to the future. Making another change adds a new entry to the past and
deletes the future. Redoing moves entries from the future to the past.
Past entries are older at higher indexes, future entries are newer at higher
indexes
